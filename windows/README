In order to get started, navigate to C:\..\Raisensu\windows\

Execute the following command to generate an encryption key (this key is needed to decrypt, so don't lose it):

`python generate_key.py`

Next, modify the settings files:

`database_settings.ini`
`monitor_settings.ini`

After, issue the following command to create your database table:

`python raisensu.py -t`

Now you have fully provisioned Raisensu and you can start adding and managing license assets.
